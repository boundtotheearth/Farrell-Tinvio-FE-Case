### Introduction
This website was created as part of my application to Tinvio for the roles of Frontend Engineer Intern. You can view the website at [here](https://farrell-tinvio-fe-case.vercel.app)

The website is built using NextJS, using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) as the http client.
Dummy data was obtained from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)


### Please follow the following steps to run the application locally:
1. Navigate to the folder where the project is located.
2. run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
3. run `npm run dev` to start the project.
4. The website can be opened in any browser at localhost:3002

### The following optional tasks were attempted:
1. User React/Typescript in your implementation

NextJS was used to build the website, which is a ReactJS framework. The project uses Typescript.

2. Add a visual loader when your data is loading

Not Attempted.

3. Add UI to allow us to switch between users in the list

An "All Users" page was added, which displays all the available users in the list. Clicking on each user will load a page containing the user's information and posts.

4. Mobile responsiveness

The website is mobile responsive. Elements resize depending on the screen size, and media queries are used to switch between different font sizes for mobile and desktop sizes.

5. Host the website for preview

The website has been hosted at [https://farrell-tinvio-fe-case.vercel.app](https://farrell-tinvio-fe-case.vercel.app)

A total of 48 hours was spent on the assignment.
